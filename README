Debug-Runopt version 1.01
=======================

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
good idea to provide version information here so that people can
decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

NAME

    Debug::Runopt - Customize how to run debugger Specify configurable debug
    options as part of rc file ie .perldb or ~/.perldb under Unix. Specify
    runtime debug commands into a file and source to debugger - works for
    interactive/non interactive both modes

SYNOPSIS

      use Debug::Runopt;

      Debug::Runopt::init();

          - Initializes debugger with a few default parse options eg.
            NonStop=1 LineInfo=db.out AutoTrace=1 frame=6
            No source command file given, debugger goes through normal execution flow.

      Debug::Runopt::init({'src'=>'tmp.cmd'});

          - Default parameters for parse_options, commands read from tmp.cmd

      Debug::Runopt::init({'src'=>'tmp.cmd', 'interactive' => 0, 'outputfile' => 'debug.out',
                         'autotrace' => 0, 'frame' => 2});

          - Sets parse_options as NonStop=0 LineInfo=debug.out AutoTrace=0 frame=2

      Debug::Runopt::init({'src'=>'tmp.cmd','parseoptions' => 'blah blah'});

          - Sets parse_options("blah blah");

      Debug::Runopt::init({'freecontent' => 'free form text blah blah....'});
   
          - Writes 'free form text blah blah' to rc file as is.
            Care should be taken while passing content like this.

      Debug::Runopt::end();

          - This can be optionally called at the end of the debuuged program
            if rc files created needs to be cleaned up

ABSTRACT

      This module tries to make debugging easy by letting user specify configurable
      options particulary when running in non-interactive mode.

      Apart from the configurable options, a source can be created on the run with user
      specified contents and run with debugger.

METHODS

      init() :: public

          - Initializes configurable options and rc file if any.

      end() :: public

          - Cleans up rc files created during execution if any.

      setParseOptions :: private

          - Sets up parse_options and other configurable directives.

      setSourceFile :: private

          - Creates rc file if required.

CAVEATS

      It works only for a few versions of Unix/Linux.
      Further improvement plan involves avoiding creating of rc file and using debug hooks.
